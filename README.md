# Frame Test

On a React Page there is an iFrame. 

In that iFrame the URL changes. 

That change should be reflected in the outer-url (of the react-page). 
For now on the url with an extra param.

### Start up

This runs on localhost. 

Run this with: 

```bash
npm run dev
```

### TODO's
- Fixed on port 5173 (Default port for Vite). iFrame should take the url from the caller.
- Translate text on page to English.
